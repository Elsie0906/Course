Question 2.3 In what order do words that have the same frequency appear in your output? (Look at the last part of your output file to see many examples of this.) Why? (Hint: look at the documentation of the sort method you called.) Would they be in a different order if we had used a HashMap?


When the words have the same frequency, it would list in alphabetic order

(a tree map guarantees that its elements will be sorted in an ascending key order)

Yes, it would be in a different order if we has used a HashMap
