KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:

Q1: When you try to get a private constant value from other files, you may call Class.const or get info from Class method
 
ex.
class name: SolitaireBoard{
	public static final int NUM_FINAL_PILES = 9;
}

1. call Class.const, ex. SolitaireBoard.NUM_FINAL_PILES

or

2. add a public method in Class and get info from this method, ex. SolitaireBoard.getPiles()

public int getPiles(){
	return NUM_FINAL_PILES;
}

Q2: convert integer to string
