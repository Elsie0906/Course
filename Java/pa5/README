with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do

----------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:

1. error: cannot jump from switch statement to this case label

If a local variable is used in switch statement, you should define a scope specific to that case

switch(val){
	case VAL:
	{
		int xxx = ...
		break;
	}
}

2. 	error: expression is not an integral constant expression
    case "insert":

Ans: string is not allowed to use in a switch statement (c/c++)
