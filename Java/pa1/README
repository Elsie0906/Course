ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

Q1: What is the probability of each of the three outcomes in a trial: two heads, one head and one tail, and two tails? Why is one of them different than the other two?

Ans: For a random access of tosses, the outcomes should be evenly distributed: HH / HT/ TH/ TT
	 (Note that HH represented to head & head; HT represented to head & tail)
	 Here, we only care about the cumulative outcome of one head and one tail (HT + TH) instead of the order
	 Therefore, the result showed that bar height of one head and one tail almost twice of the others.

Q2: Roughly how many trials do you need to do before you mostly get results within 1% of these probabilities? Do several simulations using your program to determine an answer to this.

Ans: about 10000 trials, the estimated error will be limited.

Q3: Roughly how many trials can you do before it crashes with an overflow error? State the largest value you tried where it still worked correctly, and one where it overflowed. 

Ans: Using an integer to save the number of trials may make err if the input number is larger than an integer can handled. 
(In Java, the integer is 32 bits, it ranges from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.)
